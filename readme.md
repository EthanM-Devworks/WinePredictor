This project was made as a capstone for my bachelor's of computer science at Western Governors University, and uses a truncated version of a publicly available wine dataset (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/109/wine).

INSTALLATION (Windows):  
	1.) Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/  
	2.) Install Pip from https://pypi.org/project/pip/  
	3.) Install Pandas from https://pandas.pydata.org/  
	4.) Install Scikit-learn from https://scikit-learn.org/stable/  
	5.) Install Matplotlib from https://matplotlib.org/  
	6.) Download this repo, then from file explorer, select the file path bar, enter "cmd" and enter "python main.py" within the command prompt window.  

MENU OPTION GUIDE:  
	1.) The “Predict wine quality” option will allow you to predict the quality of a wine using requested values.  
		NOTE: Insert the requested values as numbers or decimals. (Note: Do NOT insert letters or other extraneous symbols, as it WILL crash the program. Such checks are beyond the scope of this project's intentions.)  
	2.) The “View wine data table” option will allow you to see the dataset as an in-line table.  
		NOTE: You will need to expand the command prompt window to fullscreen in order to see best.  
	3.) The “View wine data bar graphs” option will allow you to see bar graphs which show the spread of all wines’ chemical values.  
		NOTE: Zooming out to full screen will help you see the graphs better.  
	4.) The “View wine data scatter plots” option will allow you to see scatter plots which compare points of data to each other in a scatter plot, which can show you trends between various qualities.  
		NOTE: You will need to enable full-screen in order to see this one well. You might also need to adjust the subplot configurations menu by clicking on the subplot configuration icon at the bottom of the window. My recommended settings, at least for a 2K monitor, are setting “top” to 1, and “bottom” to 0.05.
